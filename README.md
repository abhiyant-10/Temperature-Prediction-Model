# Temperature-Prediction-Model
<ul>
<li>Data Discovery: Worked with different CSV files containing temperature data from 8 major Indian cities.</li>
<li>Data Preparation: Merged, cleaned and processed the data by handling missing values and dropping least important factors, ensuring a refined dataset for analysis.</li>
<li>Model Planning: Analyzed the data and determined that a Linear Regression model would be the most appropriate for the prediction task.</li>
<li>Model Building: Implemented the Linear Regression model to predict temperature trends across the cities.</li>
<li>Communication of Results: Visualized the model results through relevant graphical representations, effectively communicating insights derived from the data.</li>
</ul>
