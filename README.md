# Temperature-Prediction-Model

Data Discovery: Worked with different CSV files containing temperature data from 8 major Indian cities.
Data Preparation: Merged, cleaned and processed the data by handling missing values and dropping least important factors, ensuring a refined dataset for analysis.
Model Planning: Analyzed the data and determined that a Linear Regression model would be the most appropriate for the prediction task.
Model Building: Implemented the Linear Regression model to predict temperature trends across the cities.
Communication of Results: Visualized the model results through relevant graphical representations, effectively communicating insights derived from the data.
